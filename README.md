# An E-Commerce Grocery Store website using Flask
The E-Commerce Grocery Store Web Application is a dynamic online platform designed for managing an e-commerce store. It offers core functionalities such as product management, order processing, and secure user interactions. The application is built using Flask, MySQL, and various security best practices to ensure data privacy, integrity, and safe transactions. The main focus of this project is to deliver a user-friendly, secure online shopping experience by implementing strong security measures, such as authentication, authorization, and secure session management.

## Setup and Installation Instructions -
- First clone this repository
- Then open the cloned folder
- We now need to restore the database from the dump.
- - Open the CMD in current folder and run the following command
```
mysql -u root -p online_store < Dump.sql
```
- Now create a virtual environment using the following command
```
py -m venv online_store
```
- Now activate this environment by running `.\online_store\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- Now we need to pull up the project requirements. Run the below command
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
- This completes the setup process to run the website. Just run using running the `run.py` file ðŸ˜€

## Usage Guidelines
Firstly when we open the website we are shown the login screen.
We are presented with three options
 - Use as Admin
 - Use as Seller
 - Use as a Customer

- If the user chooses login then we show the authentication form

- If the entered password is incorrect then we show the error otherwise we login the user.

- If the user is not already register we ask the relevant details from him.

## Shopping Screen
- Once the user is succesfully logged in we show him the product list

- He has the choice of adding the product to the cart. We give him confirmation once added a product succesfully.

- Then he can go to the cart and apply coupon code as well

- We are then shown the price inclusive of discount and the payment and address is asked

- We then show the user that order has been placed succesfully

## Security Improvements

The application implements the following key security improvements:

1. **Authentication**: 
   - Passwords are hashed using **Flask-Bcrypt** for secure storage.

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure that users only have access to the appropriate resources.

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - User input is validated and sanitized using **WTForms** and **markupsafe.escape**  to prevent attacks like SQL injection and XSS.

4. **Session Management**:
   - Session cookies are secured with **HttpOnly** and **Secure** flags to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Content Security**:
   - A strong **Content Security Policy (CSP)** and other headers like **X-Frame-Options** and **X-XSS-Protection** are implemented to prevent clickjacking and XSS attacks.

6. **CSRF Protection**:
   - CSRF tokens are included in forms to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Custom error handlers were implemented to handle common HTTP errors gracefully.

8. **Auditing and Logging**:
   - User actions and application events are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

9. **SQLAlchemy Database Interactions**:
   - SQLAlchemy ORM is used to reduce the risk of SQL injection and simplify database interactions.

## Testing Process

### Functional Testing
Functional testing was performed to ensure key security features are functioning correctly. Below is a summary of the key test cases executed:

| Test Case                                 | Steps Performed                                             | Expected Result                                         | Actual Result                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verify Unauthorized Access (Authentication)** | Attempt to access admin page without logging in.            | Should redirect to login page or show error.            | Unauthorized access blocked as expected.                |
| **Verify Role-Based Access Control (Authorization)** | Attempt to access admin page as a regular user.             | Regular users should be denied access.                  | Access denied as expected.                              |
| **Verify Input Validation and Sanitization** | Submit malicious payload (`' OR 1=1; --`) in registration form. | Input should be sanitized.                              | Input sanitized properly, no SQL injection.             |
| **Verify Secure Session Handling**        | Inspect cookies using developer tools.                      | Cookies should have HttpOnly and Secure flags.           | HttpOnly and Secure flags correctly set.                |

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) was performed using **Bandit**, which scans Python code for common security vulnerabilities. The scan identified the following issues:
- **Hardcoded Secret**: A medium-level risk from a hardcoded password (`app.secret_key`).
- **Unsafe YAML loading**: High-confidence issue due to `yaml.load`, which could instantiate arbitrary objects.
- **Insecure Randomness**: Use of `random.choice` and `random.randint` for cryptographic purposes.

These issues have been addressed or noted for future improvement to ensure the application follows secure coding standards.
